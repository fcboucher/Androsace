# Androsace
NGS data for species of the genus Androsace

Both datasets were produced by colleagues and myself using the ddRADseq protocol. Reads were assembled and mapped to the reference genome of Primula veris using the ipyrad software.

This dataset has been used in the following paper (which gives details on sampling, genotyping and bioinformatic treatment): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90612-w
